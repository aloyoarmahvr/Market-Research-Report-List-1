<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photodegradable Plastic Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Copolymer</li><li>Additive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The photodegradable plastic market includes two main types: copolymers and additives. Copolymer-based photodegradable plastics are created by combining different monomers, resulting in materials that break down more easily under sunlight exposure. Additives, on the other hand, are substances mixed into conventional plastics to enable photodegradation when exposed to UV light. Both types aim to reduce environmental impact by facilitating faster degradation of plastics, making them more environmentally friendly alternatives to traditional, non-degradable materials.</p></p>
