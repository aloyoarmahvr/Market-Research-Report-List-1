<p><h1>Indirect Tire Pressure Monitoring System (iTPMS) Market Size Reflecting a Forecast Till 2032: Market By Type, By Application and By Geography</h1></p><p><strong>Indirect Tire Pressure Monitoring System (iTPMS) Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>The Indirect Tire Pressure Monitoring System (iTPMS) is a technology that monitors tire pressure indirectly through the vehicle's antilock braking system (ABS) wheel speed sensors. By analyzing the rotational speed of each wheel, iTPMS can detect discrepancies in tire pressure, indicating under-inflation. This system is often regarded as a cost-effective alternative to direct tire pressure monitoring systems (dTPMS), as it does not rely on additional sensors within the tire itself.</p><p>The iTPMS Market is witnessing robust growth, driven by increasing safety concerns, regulatory mandates, and consumer awareness regarding tire maintenance. The market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 12.3% during the forecast period. Factors such as advancements in automotive technologies, rising electric vehicle adoption, and enhancements in vehicle safety features further contribute to this growth. Additionally, the trend toward integration of smart technologies and connectivity in vehicles is pushing innovations in iTPMS. As OEMs strive to improve fuel efficiency and reduce vehicle emissions, iTPMS continues to play a crucial role in tire performance management. Overall, the iTPMS market is set for significant expansion, underscoring the importance of tire safety in modern automotive designs.</p></p>
